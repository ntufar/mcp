# Feature Specification: MCP File Browser Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-to-create`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "project to create MCP Server to help LLM to browse local directories and files"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an LLM using the MCP protocol, I want to browse and access local files and directories so that I can help users with file management, content analysis, and directory navigation tasks while maintaining security and performance standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an LLM client connected to the MCP server, **When** requesting to list directory contents, **Then** the system returns a structured list of files and subdirectories with metadata (size, permissions, modification date)
2. **Given** an LLM client with appropriate permissions, **When** requesting to read a specific file, **Then** the system returns file contents with proper encoding detection and size validation
3. **Given** an LLM client, **When** requesting access to a restricted directory, **Then** the system denies access and logs the attempt for security audit
4. **Given** an LLM client, **When** requesting to search for files by name or content, **Then** the system returns matching files with their locations and relevant metadata
5. **Given** an LLM client, **When** requesting file system operations on large directories (>10,000 files), **Then** the system completes operations within acceptable time limits (2 seconds for listing)

### Edge Cases
- Symbolic links should be followed to their target files/directories, but also clearly marked as symbolic links in metadata
- How does the system handle concurrent access to the same files by multiple LLM clients?
- What happens when the LLM requests access to system-critical directories like /etc or /root?
- How does the system handle file permission changes during active operations?
- What occurs when disk space is exhausted during file operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide directory listing functionality with file metadata (name, size, permissions, modification date, type)
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement configurable directory access controls with allowlist/denylist support
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **FR-004**: System MUST respect operating system file permissions and never bypass security controls
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all file access attempts with user context, file paths, and operation outcomes
- **FR-006**: System MUST support file content reading with encoding detection and size limits
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide file search capabilities by name, extension, and content patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement caching for frequently accessed directories and file metadata
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle large files through streaming to prevent memory exhaustion
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose all functionality through standard MCP protocol tools and resources
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide structured error responses with appropriate detail levels
- **FR-012**: System MUST support concurrent operations from multiple LLM clients
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement configurable resource limits (memory usage, file size, directory depth)
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide health checks and performance metrics for monitoring
- **FR-015**: System MUST support graceful degradation when system resources are constrained
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle symbolic links by following them to target files/directories while clearly marking them as symbolic links in metadata

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Directory**: Represents a file system directory with metadata (path, permissions, modification time, file count)
- **File**: Represents a file system file with metadata (path, size, permissions, modification time, content type)
- **Access Log**: Represents an audit record of file system operations (timestamp, user, operation, path, outcome)
- **Configuration**: Represents server settings (allowed paths, permission levels, cache settings, resource limits)
- **Cache Entry**: Represents cached file metadata or directory listings with TTL and invalidation rules
