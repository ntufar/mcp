# Implementation Plan: MCP File Browser Server

**Branch**: `002-plan-implementation-for` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: `/specs/002-plan-implementation-for/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-plan-implementation-for/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create an MCP server that enables LLMs to securely browse and access local file systems with comprehensive security controls, performance optimization, and MCP protocol compliance. Technical approach: Build a single Node.js/TypeScript server with streaming file operations, intelligent caching, and strict path validation following security-first architecture principles.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5.0+  
**Primary Dependencies**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, fs-extra, chokidar, node-cache, joi  
**Storage**: File system cache (in-memory with TTL), audit logs (JSON files)  
**Testing**: Jest, supertest, mock-fs, LLM client integration testing  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)  
**Project Type**: single (MCP server application)  
**Performance Goals**: 2s response for 10k+ file directories, 50 concurrent operations, <100MB memory usage  
**Constraints**: <500ms metadata retrieval, <100MB memory footprint, streaming for large files  
**Scale/Scope**: 50+ concurrent LLM clients, unlimited file system access (within security bounds)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Security-First Architecture Compliance
- ✅ **Path Validation**: Canonical path resolution with traversal attack prevention
- ✅ **Sandboxing**: Configurable allowlist/denylist for directory access
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: All file operations logged with user context and paths
- ✅ **System Protection**: Never expose sensitive directories (/etc, /root, /home) by default

### Permission-Based Access Control
- ✅ **Permission Verification**: All operations verify user permissions before execution
- ✅ **Granular Permissions**: Read-only, read-write, admin levels supported
- ✅ **OS Compliance**: Never bypass operating system permission checks

### Efficient Streaming & Caching
- ✅ **Streaming Support**: Large files handled via streaming to prevent memory exhaustion
- ✅ **Intelligent Caching**: Configurable cache TTL and size limits
- ✅ **Cache Invalidation**: File system change detection (chokidar)

### MCP Protocol Compliance
- ✅ **Standard Tools**: All functionality exposed through MCP tools and resources
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with appropriate detail levels
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Support for MCP protocol versions

### Test-First Development
- ✅ **TDD Mandatory**: Tests written before implementation for all file operations
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Path traversal, permission edge cases, large files, concurrent access
- ✅ **Mock File Systems**: Deterministic unit tests using mock file systems

### Observable Operations
- ✅ **Structured Logging**: Operation type, file paths, timing, success/failure status
- ✅ **Health Checks**: File system accessibility and performance metrics
- ✅ **Error Messages**: Detailed troubleshooting without exposing sensitive paths

**Status**: ✅ ALL CONSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS SATISFIED

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - MCP server is a standalone application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**MCP File Browser Server Specific Tasks**:
- **Security Layer**: Path validation, permission checking, audit logging
- **File System Interface**: Directory listing, file reading, metadata retrieval
- **Caching System**: Cache implementation, TTL management, invalidation
- **MCP Protocol**: Tool definitions, error handling, response formatting
- **Performance**: Streaming implementation, concurrent handling, resource limits
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Test framework setup, mock file systems, test utilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, security tests, performance tests
- **LLM Integration Testing**: Real LLM client testing, workflow validation, user experience testing

**Testing-First Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation for ALL components
- Testing infrastructure setup before any implementation
- Security tests before security implementation
- Performance tests before performance optimization
- LLM integration tests before final deployment
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Security-first: Path validation tests before any file operations

**Estimated Output**: 40-45 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- 8 testing infrastructure setup tasks [P]
- 12 unit test implementation tasks [P]
- 8 integration test tasks
- 6 security test tasks [P]
- 6 performance test tasks [P]
- 4 LLM integration test tasks
- 8 implementation tasks (security, file system, caching, MCP protocol)
- 5 documentation and deployment tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## LLM Integration Testing Strategy
