# Tasks: MCP File Browser Server

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-plan-implementation-for/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Task Generation Rules Applied

### From Contracts
- `contracts/mcp-tools.yaml` → T009 (contract test)
- `contracts/contract-tests.test.ts` → T010 (OpenAPI test)

### From Data Model
- Directory entity → T025 (model task)
- File entity → T026 (model task)
- PermissionInfo entity → T027 (model task)
- AccessLog entity → T028 (model task)
- Configuration entity → T029 (model task)
- CacheEntry entity → T030 (model task)

### From User Stories (Quickstart)
- Directory listing scenario → T011 (integration test)
- File reading scenario → T012 (integration test)
- File search scenario → T013 (integration test)
- Permission checking scenario → T014 (integration test)
- Metadata retrieval scenario → T015 (integration test)

### From LLM Integration Strategy
- Claude integration → T022 (LLM test)
- GPT-4 integration → T023 (LLM test)
- Gemini integration → T024 (LLM test)

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T009, T010)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T025-T030)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T009-T024 before T025+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Security tests cover all attack vectors
- [x] Performance tests cover all benchmarks
- [x] LLM integration tests cover major clients
- [x] All 64 requirements from specification covered

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify all tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow constitutional principles: security-first, test-driven, performance-oriented
- Each task is specific enough for LLM execution without additional context
- Total tasks: 64 (comprehensive coverage of all requirements)
