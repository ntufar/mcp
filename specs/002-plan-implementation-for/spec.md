## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an LLM using the MCP protocol, I want to browse and access local files and directories so that I can help users with file management, content analysis, and directory navigation tasks while maintaining security and performance standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an LLM client connected to the MCP server, **When** requesting to list directory contents, **Then** the system returns a structured list of files and subdirectories with metadata (size, permissions, modification date)
2. **Given** an LLM client with appropriate permissions, **When** requesting to read a specific file, **Then** the system returns file contents with proper encoding detection and size validation
3. **Given** an LLM client, **When** requesting access to a restricted directory, **Then** the system denies access and logs the attempt for security audit
4. **Given** an LLM client, **When** requesting to search for files by name or content, **Then** the system returns matching files with their locations and relevant metadata
5. **Given** an LLM client, **When** requesting file system operations on large directories (>10,000 files), **Then** the system completes operations within acceptable time limits (2 seconds for listing)

### Edge Cases
- Symbolic links should be followed to their target files/directories, but also clearly marked as symbolic links in metadata
- How does the system handle concurrent access to the same files by multiple LLM clients?
- What happens when the LLM requests access to system-critical directories like /etc or /root?
- How does the system handle file permission changes during active operations?
- What occurs when disk space is exhausted during file operations?
