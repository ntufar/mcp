## 🔧 Usage

### MCP Protocol Integration

The server exposes the following MCP tools and resources:

#### Tools
- `list_directory` - List directory contents with metadata
- `read_file` - Read file contents with streaming support
- `search_files` - Search files by name, extension, or content
- `get_file_metadata` - Retrieve detailed file information
- `check_permissions` - Verify file/directory access permissions

#### Resources
- Directory listings with structured metadata
- File contents with encoding detection
- Search results with relevance scoring
- System health and performance metrics

### Example Usage
```javascript
// List directory contents
const directoryListing = await mcpClient.callTool('list_directory', {
  path: '/home/user/projects',
  includeHidden: false,
  maxDepth: 2
});

// Read file with streaming
const fileContent = await mcpClient.callTool('read_file', {
  path: '/home/user/documents/example.txt',
  encoding: 'utf-8',
  maxSize: '10MB'
});

// Search files
const searchResults = await mcpClient.callTool('search_files', {
  query: 'configuration',
  searchPath: '/home/user',
  fileTypes: ['.json', '.yaml', '.conf']
});
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **Security Layer**: Path validation, permission checking, audit logging
- **File System Interface**: Abstraction layer for file operations
- **Caching Engine**: Intelligent metadata and content caching
- **MCP Protocol Handler**: Standard MCP tools and resources
- **Monitoring System**: Health checks and performance metrics

### Data Flow
```
LLM Client → MCP Protocol → Security Validation → File System → Cache → Response
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Tests written before implementation for all file system operations
- **90%+ Code Coverage**: Mandatory coverage for file system operation modules
- **Mock File Systems**: Deterministic unit tests using mock file systems
- **Real LLM Integration**: Testing with actual LLM clients (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Qwen, OpenCode)

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mock file systems
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end MCP protocol testing
- **Security Tests**: Path traversal, permission boundary testing, attack prevention
- **Performance Tests**: Large directory and file handling with specific benchmarks
- **Concurrent Tests**: Multi-client operation testing
- **Contract Tests**: API contract validation with OpenAPI specification
- **LLM Integration Tests**: Real LLM client workflow validation

### LLM Client Testing
- **Universal Compatibility**: Testing across all major LLM platforms

### Security Best Practices
1. **Configure allowlists** for production deployments
2. **Monitor audit logs** for suspicious access patterns
3. **Regular security updates** and vulnerability scanning
4. **Principle of least privilege** for file system access
5. **Encryption at rest** for sensitive configuration data
