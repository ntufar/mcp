# MCP File Browser Server Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
ALL file system operations MUST implement strict path validation and sandboxing. 
NEVER expose sensitive system directories (/etc, /home, /root) by default. 
Implement configurable allowlists/denylists for directory access. 
All file operations MUST log access attempts with user context and file paths for audit trails.

### II. Permission-Based Access Control
EVERY file/directory operation MUST verify user permissions before execution. 
Implement granular permission levels: read-only, read-write, admin. 
Support both user-level and system-level permission overrides via configuration. 
NEVER bypass operating system permission checks; work within established security boundaries.

### III. Efficient Streaming & Caching
Large file operations MUST use streaming to prevent memory exhaustion. 
Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed directories and file metadata. 
Provide configurable cache TTL and size limits. 
Support cache invalidation on file system changes (via inotify/FSEvents where available).

### IV. MCP Protocol Compliance
ALL functionality MUST be exposed through standard MCP tools and resources. 
Implement proper error handling with structured error responses. 
Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations where appropriate. 
Maintain backward compatibility with MCP protocol versions.

### V. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory for ALL file system operations: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. 
Integration tests REQUIRED for: Path traversal scenarios, permission edge cases, large file handling, concurrent access patterns. 
Mock file systems MUST be used for unit tests to ensure deterministic behavior.

### VI. Observable Operations
ALL file operations MUST generate structured logs with operation type, file paths, timing, and success/failure status. 
Implement health checks for file system accessibility and performance metrics. 
Provide detailed error messages for troubleshooting without exposing sensitive path information.

## Security & Privacy

### Path Validation Standards
Implement canonical path resolution to prevent directory traversal attacks. 
Validate all input paths against configured base directories. 
Support symbolic link resolution with security controls (follow/deny policies). 
Provide path sanitization utilities for safe path construction.

### Data Protection
NEVER log file contents in plain text; use content hashes for identification. 
Implement configurable data retention policies for operation logs. 
Support encryption for sensitive configuration files and cache data. 
Provide secure credential management for elevated permission scenarios.

### Audit & Compliance
Generate comprehensive audit logs for all file system access. 
Support integration with external logging and monitoring systems. 
Implement configurable access reporting and alerting mechanisms. 
Maintain operation history with configurable retention periods.

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Requirements
Directory listing operations MUST complete within 2 seconds for directories up to 10,000 files. 
File metadata retrieval MUST complete within 500ms for files up to 100MB. 
Concurrent operation support for at least 50 simultaneous requests. 
Implement request queuing and throttling to prevent system overload.

### Resource Management
Memory usage MUST remain under 100MB for normal operations. 
Implement configurable limits for file size operations and directory depth traversal. 
Support graceful degradation when system resources are constrained. 
Provide resource usage monitoring and alerting.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
ALL code changes MUST pass comprehensive test suites before merge. 
Code coverage MUST exceed 90% for file system operation modules. 
Security-focused code reviews REQUIRED for all file access implementations. 
Performance benchmarks MUST be maintained and validated with each release.

### Release Management
Follow semantic versioning with security patches receiving priority. 
Maintain backward compatibility for at least 2 major versions. 
Provide migration guides for breaking changes. 
Implement automated security vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and MUST be followed by all contributors. 
Amendments require documentation of rationale, security impact assessment, and approval from project maintainers. 
All PRs and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. 
Complexity additions MUST be justified with performance, security, or functionality benefits.
